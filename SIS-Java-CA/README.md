This is a project I completed for school at WLAC.
It is a Student Registration system.  
It allows you to:
- Add/Edit/Delete a Department
- Add/Edit/Delete an Instructor
- Assign an Instructor to a Department
- Add/Edit/Delete a Course
- Add/Edit/Delete a Student
- Register/Unregister for Class

The software is implemented with a REST API using MySQL as the DB. 
I used JavaFX for the GUI, and FXML to manage the Control Flow. 

I believe there was a few objects that did not have the delete option 
implemented due to time constraints on the project.

At the time of working on it, I hadn't learned to 
utilize source control and I actually lost a large chunk of the project
and had to restart.

I have since learned my lesson.  

Although my code is extremely readable, I am disappointed my lack of comments
after returning to the project.  Perhaps I can fill them in during a bout of
insomnia....
